## Inroduction

**_Node_** is a multipurpose discord _Bot_. Specially made for _Moderation_ & _Server-Management_. It only supports slash-commands. It was made with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) which is a powerful [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) module that allows you to easily interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

Written above are some commands of the bot. I'm planing on adding new commands with each version update. As of now the bot has a _Member-Logging_ & _Welcoming-System_. But only availabe for the test server which is **[Ghost Nation](https://discord.gg/E6H9VvBdTk)**. You are welcome to join if you want. The above mentioned features will be updated soon. So, that everyone can use and make custome welcome messages for their own servers.
